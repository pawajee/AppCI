Aurum:
	No drug produces a more acute depression than Aurum. The Aurum state is one of hopelessness that makes the patient oblivious to everything around them. Aurums are full of melancholy, long for death and show a tendency towards suicide.
	
	The Aurum patient has overinvested in something in their life — job, love, business, religion; or, given their all and lost.
	
	And, so as a result, the Aurum patient sits wrapped in deep thought, numbed and not able to respond to their surroundings. They notice nothing.
	
	In the Aurum state, the spirit is so depressed that there is a loss of enjoyment in everything. Aurums believe they have greatly neglected their duty and friends. They feel themselves unworthy of salivation and all these thoughts are uncontrollable, and also constantly preoccupying their minds. Aurum sits and broods over these imaginings saying nothing, and as the brooding intensifies, new grievances are born.

Veratrum Album:
	Veratrum album produces alternating states of brooding, screaming and screeching. 
	The remedy is full of hopelessness, especially despair of recovery. 
	We can see melancholy with the head hanging down. The Veratrum sits brooding in silence and the brooding is pronounced in the evening. The patient may brood, or sulk, over their own state, or over the state of 	the world. They are tired of life and suffer great grief. They are inconsolable over their misfortune — as they sit and brood.
