Homeopathic Treatment of OCD?

Along with OCD, I have seen, many patients are fearful and nervous and have impulse to jump out of window, faintish and tremulous, having errors of perception and they want to do things in a hurry with peculiar mental impulses. The remedy in those cases I selected is Argentum Nitricum higher potencies. When I got OCD patients with alternating moods, very irritable, full of fear and imaginations, never want to be left alone and obstinate and hypersensitive to pain, noise and touch, I preferred to prescribe Kali Carbonicum higher dilutions. I got great result using Stannam Metalicum 200 as complementary medicine after 2-3 months of treatment. Some OCD patients are apathetic, feels as if going insane or being paralyzed, fears the night, and the suffering from exhaustion on awakening, hopeless, despairs of recovery. And also when they are having loss of memory and remember everything previous to his illness, I consider Syphilinum 10M or 50 M to start with for controlling obsession and compulsions. For therapeutic use, I have been giving Apocynum Cannabinum Q (Mother Tincture), Serum Anguillae 7x and Rhamnus California Q, and Lithium Benzoicum 3x (Trituration), Ammonium Valerianicum 8x for symptomatic relief. Most of the OCD patients are cured by homeopathic medicines; rest can be managed to some extent. But none of these homeopathic medicines for OCD should be taken without professional advice from a consultant Homeopath in Neuro-Psychiatry.
