Abstract
Objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common type of cancer among the hematological malignancies that is difficult to treat and is characterized by the enlargement of malignant monoclonal B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow, often leading to progressive bone lesions. Even though, alternative treatment strategies that combine high-dose chemotherapy with support of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are more effective in younger patients than in older patients, the drugs used in chemotherapy for MM increase the risk of developing secondary hematological malignancies such as treatment-related myelodysplastic syndromes. Homeopathy, a traditional and alternative treatment, is used by many cancer patients in many countries with maximum effect at low doses. Hecla lava is a homeopathic medicine used in bone cancers. However, studies showing the molecular mechanism of action of this remedy in cancer are very limited in the literature. In this study, we aimed to show the cytotoxic effect of Hecla lava on MM cell lines.

Methods: RPMI 8226 cell line was cultured with RPMI 1640 growth medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100g/ml streptomycin, and 1,2 ml L-Glutamine and maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells (104 cells/well) were seeded to 96-well plates and treated with Hecla lava. The cell proliferation assay was performed by MTT (methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay in 3 replicates using the cells incubated for 24, 48 and 72 hours with increasing concentrations (200, 600, 1000 μg/μL) of Hecla lava (200C) dissolved in sterile distilled water. The optical density of each sample was determined with a spectrophotometric plate reader at 550 nm, using 690 nm as a reference. Cell viability of untreated cells was accepted as 100% and percentage of cell viability in each treatment group was calculated accordingly.

Results: At 200 μg/μL concentration of Hecla lava (200C), MM cells showed 54.77%, 68.70% and 53.56% viability at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. At the concentration of 600 μg/μL, cell viability was found to be 51.15%, 58.83% and 33.06% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively and at the concentration of 1000 μg/μL, cell viability was found to be 45.83%, 46.05% and 26.21% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. IC50 value (Inhibitory Concentration 50%) was found to be 240.30 μg/μL for 72nd hours.

Conclusion: With this preliminary study, it has been shown for the first time that the 200C potency of Hecla lava, a homeopathic remedy, has a high cytotoxic effect at increasing doses in multiple myeloma cell lines, especially in continuous use, while the amount of dose used decreases, its cytotoxic effect on cancerous cells increases. According to these results, Hecla lava may be a homeopathic agent that can be used in combination with existing treatments in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The next step of our work will be to show how Hecla lava exerts its anticancer effect and eliminates cancer cells.
